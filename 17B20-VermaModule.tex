\newcommand{\fr}[1]{\mathfrak{#1}}
Let $\fr g$ be a semi-simple Lie algebra, $\fr h$ a Cartan subalgebra, and
$\fr b$ a Borel subalgebra.  We work over a field $F$.  Given a weight $\lambda \in \fr h^*$, let $F_{\lambda}$ be the 1-d dimensional $\fr b$-module on which $\fr h$ acts by multiplication by $\lambda$, and the positive root spaces act trivially.  Now, the Verma module $M_\lambda$ of the weight $\lambda$ is the $\fr g$-module induced from $F_\lambda$, i.e.

$$M_\lambda = \mathcal{U}(\fr g) \otimes_{\mathcal{U}(\fr b)} F_\lambda.$$  

Using the PoincarÃ©-Birkhoff-Witt theorem we see that as a vector space $M_\lambda$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{U}(\overline{\fr n})$, where $\overline{\fr n}$ is the sum of the negative weight spaces (so $\fr g = \fr b \oplus \overline{\fr n})$. In particular $M_\lambda$ is infinite dimensional. 

We say a $\fr g$-module $V$ is a highest weight module if it has a weight $\mu \in \fr h^*$ and a non-zero vector $v \in V_\mu$ with $Xv = 0$ for any $X$ in a positive root space and such that $V$ is generated as a $\fr g$-module by $v$. The Verma module $M_\lambda$ is a highest weight module and we fix a generator $1 \otimes 1$.

The most important property of Verma modules is that they are universal amongst highest weight modules, in the following sense. If $V$ is a highest weight module generated by $v$ which has weight $\lambda$ then there is a unique surjective homomorphism $M_\lambda\to V$ which sends $1 \otimes 1$ to $v$.  That is, all highest weight modules with highest weight $\lambda$ are quotients of $M_\lambda$.  Also, $M_\lambda$ has a unique maximal submodule, so there is a unique irreducible representation with highest weight $\lambda$. If $\lambda$ is dominant and integral then this module is finite dimensional.
