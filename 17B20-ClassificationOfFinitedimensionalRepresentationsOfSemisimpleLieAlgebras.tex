\begin{document}
If $\mathfrak{g}$ is a semi-simple Lie algebra, then we say that an  representation $V$
has highest weight $\lambda$, if there is a vector $v\in V_\lambda$, the weight space of
$\lambda$, such that $Xv=0$ for $X$ in any positive root space, and $v$ is called a {\em highest 
vector}, or {\em vector of highest weight}.

There is a unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible
finite dimensional representation of $\mathfrak{g}$ with highest weight $\lambda$ for any dominant
weight $\lambda\in\Lambda_W$, where $\Lambda_W$ is the weight lattice of $\mathfrak{g}$, and
every irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{g}$ is of this type.
