\begin{thm}[Local Nagano Theorem]
Let $\Omega \subset {\mathbb{R}}^n$ be an open neighbourhood of a point
$x^0$.  Further let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of
real analytic real vector fields on $\Omega$ which is also a
$C^\omega(\Omega;{\mathbb{R}})$-module.  Then there exists a real analytic
submanifold $M \subset \Omega$ with $x^0 \in M$, such that for all $x \in M$
we have
\begin{equation*}
T_x(M) = \mathfrak{g}(x) .
\end{equation*}
Furthermore the germ of $M$ at $x$ is the unique germ of a submanifold with
this property.
\end{thm}

Here note that $T_x(M)$ is the tangent space of $M$ at $x$,
$C^\omega(\Omega;{\mathbb{R}})$ are the real analytic real valued functions
on $\Omega$.  Also real analytic real vector fields on $\Omega$ are the
real analytic sections of $T(\Omega)$, the real tangent bundle of $\Omega$.

\begin{defn}
The germ of the manifold $M$ is called the {\em local Nagano leaf} of 
$\mathfrak{g}$ at $x_0$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
The union of all connected real analytic embedded submanifolds of $\Omega$ whose
germ at $x_0$ coincides with the germ of $M$ at $x_0$ is called the
{\em global Nagano leaf}. 
\end{defn}

The global Nagano leaf turns out to be a connected immersed real analytic submanifold which may however not be an embedded submanifold of $\Omega$.
